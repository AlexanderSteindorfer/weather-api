# Weather API
Shows the current weather for a city.
<br/><br/>

### **Short explanation**
This simple software uses an API from **openweathermap.org** to show the weather (metric system) for a city that the user enters in the terminal.

It will show:
- city and country
- date and time 
- temperature
- weather description
- wind speed and direction
<br/><br/>

### **How to use**
First you need to create a free account at https://openweathermap.org/ to receive an API key. 
Open **weather_api.py** and paste your key into the constant variable API_KEY (as string!). Run the code and enter a city into the terminal when prompted. 

*Keep your API keys private at all times! Do not include them in public repositories!*
